# Contributing Guide

The discussions about any sort of problems or improvements take place in the [Issues](https://github.com/artur-deluca/psopt/issues) section. Feel free to dig into and make your own suggestions!

### Contributing 101

**1. _Fork_ this repository**

There's a big button for that in the GitHub repository interface, usually on the top right corner.

**2. Clone your fork of the repository**

```console
$ git clone http://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/psopt.git
```
**3. Install dependencies**

Make sure to create a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to encapsulate the dependencies.
Please refer to [Installation](https://github.com/artur-deluca/psopt/tree/docs#installing-from-source) for further support on installing dependencies.

**4. Create a feature branch**

```console
$ git checkout -b <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>-new-feature
```

Please, note that we prefix branch names with GitHub usernames, this helps us in keeping track of changes and who is working on them.


**5. Implement changes**

Great! Now it's time to generate your own changes to the project!

**6. Commit your changes**

```console
$ git commit -am 'my contribution commit message'
```

**7. Push to the branch to your fork**

```console
$ git push origin <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>-new-feature
```

**8. Create a new _Pull Request_**

From your fork at GitHub usually there is a button to open pull requests.
