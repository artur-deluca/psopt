Contributing 101

**2. Clone your fork of the repository**

::

    $ git clone http://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/psopt.git


**3. Install dependencies**

Make sure to create a `virtual environment <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/>`_ to encapsulate the dependencies.
Please refer to `Installation <install.html>`_ for further support on installing dependencies.

**4. Create a feature branch**

::

    $ git checkout -b <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>-new-feature


Please, note that we prefix branch names with GitHub usernames, this helps us in keeping track of changes and who is working on them.

Great! Now it's time to generate your own changes to the project!

**6. Commit your changes**

::

    $ git commit -am 'my contribution commit message'
